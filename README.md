## **My Reading Notes Course 102**

 *Hi my name is **Yasmin** and I want learning to code*

Growth mindset means to me that you thrive on challenges, and donâ€™t see failure as a way to describe yourself but as a springboard for growth and developing your abilities. Your intelligence and talents are all susceptible to growth.

### **3 reminders to stay in growth minds are**

- Recongize you have a choice
- Talk with growth mindset voice
- Practice
