my reading journal for 102d45

Hi my name is Yasmin and I want learning to code

Growth mindset means to me that you thrive on challenges, and donâ€™t see failure as a way to describe yourself but as a springboard for growth and developing your abilities. Your intelligence and talents are all susceptible to growth.

3 reminders to stay in growth minds are

1. Recongize you have a choice
2. Talk with growth mindset voice
3. Practice
