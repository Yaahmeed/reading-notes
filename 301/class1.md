Reusability, Replaceable, Not context specific, Extensible, Encapsulated, Independent  

3. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?  
Ease of deployment, Reduced cost, Ease of development, Reusable, Reliability, Independent, Modification of technical complexity (modifies through use of component container and its services), System maintenance and evolution (easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system)
