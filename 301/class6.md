## Introduction to Node.js  

1. Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.  
Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library. [sitepoint.com](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/)  

2. The V8 Engine is an engine built to compile JavaScript directly to machine code that our computers can execute.  

3. Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, JavaScript runtime. [sitepoint.com](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/)

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming  

1. Greater efficiency, engaged collaboration, learning from fellow students, social skills, job interview readiness, and work environment readiness.  

2. In my experience, I have found engaged collaboration and learning from other students to be most beneficial.  

3. In pair programming there is a Driver and a Navigator. The Driver is the person that is typing and the only person whose hands are on the keyboard. The Navigator is using their words to guide the Driver; thinking about what might need to come next, how the algorithm might be converted into code, and scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator should not be writing any code. [codefellows.org](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)
