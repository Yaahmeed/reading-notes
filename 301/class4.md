# React and Forms  

## Forms  

1. A Controlled Component is a combination of HTML element state and React mutable state (updated with `setState()`), making React state the "single source of truth". An input element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a "Controlled Component" [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)  

2. The form should update the React state on every keystroke. With a controlled component, the input value is always driven by the React state. This allows the value to be passed to other UI elements too, or to reset it from other event handlers. [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)  

3. We can add a name attribute (`event.target.name`) to each element and let the handler function choose to do based on the value input. [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)  

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator  

1. A Ternary operator would be used in place of an if statement/if else conditional

2. `x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)`
