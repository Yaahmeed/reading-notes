# More CRUD  

## CRUD Basics  

1. You would use PUT or PATCH  

2. Any that operate on a specific resource rather than on a collection of resources.  (GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)  

## Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API  

1. Create (POST); Read (GET); Update (PUT/PATCH); Delete (DELETE)  

2. Define the resource(s)(Data you want to be available through an API); Design the endpoint(S)(URLs for each resource and HTTP methods that will be used to interact with them); Implement server side logic(Handle incoming requests and perform appropriate CRUD operations); Test the API(Send requests and check responses); Document the API(Info on resources, endpoints, etc.)
