1. SQL                NoSQL  
-SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.  

-SQL databases are table-based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores  

-SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.  

-SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.  

-SQL databases uses SQL (structured query language) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents

1. Structured Query Language  

2. A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.  

3. A table structure; rows and columns  

4. What a database table looks like in sql.  

5. NoSQL databases are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL uses Collections and Documents  

6. Data is stored and retrieved in JSON like files using Collections containing Documents. Data is typically merged/nested in a few collections  

7. Collections containing Documents to store data  

8. MongoDB is more flexible because it is schema-less, has no (or very few) relations, scalable both horizontally and vertically, great performance for mass (simple) read and write requests.  

9. Non-relational. Have some duplicate data.
