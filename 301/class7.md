# REST  

## How I explained REST to my brother  

1. Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers that sent documents across the internet; and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. [Conversation about REST](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)  

2. Because the original design just needed to be able to talk to a small group of machines.  
"Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines."

3. HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a protocol for sending and receiving information across the web.  

4. A GET is used to retrieve information from a server.  

5. A POST is used to submit information to a server.  

6. A PUT is used to update a resource on a server.  

7. a PATCH is used to partially update a resource on a server.
