# Foundations  

## Why these topics matter as it relates to this this module  

Using images and changing colors and text styles can make a webpage feel more friendly and easier to read.

### HTML Media

1. A real world case for using `alt` in a website is to describe what is displayed in the image so that a screen reader can give the picture some meaning for a person that is visually impaired. This is also useful if the image link is broken.  
2. Make your `alt` tag contain a thorough (yet brief) definition for the image, or include it in the main text for everyone to read. Just be sure to not display the same text twice!  
3. A `<figure>` element is useful for adding a caption to an image within a single block of HTML, however a figure doesnt have to be an image as it is an independent unit of content, or a figure could be several items.  
4. A GIF is an animated image (it moves). An SVG is treated as an image (doesn't move).
5. I would use a PNG as it is a static image that has good browser support.  

### CSS  

 1. The foreground color is the color of what ever is in the foreground of the page, such as text. The background color is the background. ie: white text on a black page / white crayon on a black paper (white is foregroung, black is background).  
 2. I would change the background and text colors to achieve something that is readable but doesn't hurt ones eyes. Maybe try to associate the colors with what the blog is about.  
 3. Things to consider when using fonts in an HTML document: browser compatibility, readability
 4. `font-size` is used to adjust the size of the text in a browser window. `font-weight` is used to set how **bold** the text is.  `font-style` is used to turn *italic* text on or off.  
 5. Two ways to add spacing around characters in an `<h1>` element are: text layout styles. ie: text-indent, white-space, text-orientation.
