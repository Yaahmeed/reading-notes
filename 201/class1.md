# Class 1 Notes

## Getting Started

1. HTTP Sends Data a Poem:
A browser requests web data,
the HTTP finds the address,
the server at address approves a users request,
and your browser assembles the page.
2. The browser will parse the HTML file first and send a request back to the server for any CSS <"link"> or JavaScript <"script"> elements. The browser will then parse the CSS and JavaScript. The browser will generate an in-memory DOM tree and compile and apply these files into a visual representation on the users screen.
3. To find images to add to a website, ensure the copywrite is either your own, OR find a free image source, such as unsplash. Save the image, add an <"img"> element to your HTML with the correct file path. Give credit to image source beneath the image.
4. A string variable in JavaScript is enclosed in 'quote marks' whereas a number variable is a number and NOT enclosed in quote marks.
5. A variable in Javascript is a container that stores values. They are important to that the script writer can use the value multiple times.

## Introduction to HTML

1. An HTML attribute is extra information about the element that won't appear in the content of the page. Attributes are also used to identify and specific elements within an HTML document and apply changes via other linked files, such as CSS.
2. The anatomy of an HTML element: opening tag, content, closing tag. ie: <"p">Hello there!<"/p">
3. An Article is for enclosing a block of related content that makes sense on its own, without the rest of the page. A Section is similar to Article, but is more for grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes one single piece of functionality or theme. You can break an Article up into different Sections, or break a Section up into different Articles, depending on context.
4. A typical website includes many Elements, such as: <"html">, <"head">, <"title">, <"header">, <"h1">, <"body">, <"p">, <"footer">, and all of the associated closing tags and content of the page.
5. Metadata can influence search engine optimization by including keywords related to the content of your page, your page can appear higher in relevant searches.
6. The <"meta"> tag is used in the page <"head"> along with the language, name, and content descriptors and keywords.

## Miscellaneous

### How to start to design a Website

1. The first step to designing a website (once you know the website topic/what your goal is) is sketching and then wireframing the layout of the webpage.
2. The most important question to answer then designing a website is, what do you want to accomplish?

### Semantics

1. You would use an <"h1"> because, 1 - it IS a top-level heading, 2 - most browsers will style an <"h1"> as a top-level heading by default, 3 - it applies semantic value to the content. While you can make <"span"> look like a top-level heading, it is not a semantic value and will not receive any extra benefits.
2. In HTML, semantic tags tell what purpose or roll an HTML element has. In addition, search engines will consider page contents and keywords based on semantic elements, screen readers can use it to help visually impaired navigate a page, finding blocks of meaningful code is easier.

### What is JavaScript

1. Two things that require JavaScript in the browser are interactive questions/buttons, and run code in responses to specified events occurring on the page.
2. You can add JavaScript to an HTML document either internally (not best practice), or by linking to an external <"script"> file (best practice).
