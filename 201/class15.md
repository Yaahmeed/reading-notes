# Pshcyological Safety  

- I have always been one to try to separate work life and home life as best that I can. This really is not possible though, and there is always spillover between the two. I was fortunate enough to have a very psychologically safe environment at my provious job. The team would get together in the mornings and chat about life as we were getting ready for our day. I found that on days where this didn't happen, my day was usually less fulfilling. We were also encouraged to collaborate, especially when we encountered a problem diagnosing equipmet. There were times when I needed to call my manager or another more expirienced technician to figure out an issue, and there were times when they encountered something and would call me. We collectively realized that we all have had different expirences and we all wanted to share our knowledge and expirence.  
As I was preparing to leave my previous job to attend Code Fellows, I was still in the process of training an apprentice. For the last week or so, Dispatch was reluctant to have the apprentice ride with me, until I relayed to him that I had a desire to pass on as much of my knowledge as I was able before I left.  
"Psychological Safety" is extremely important to a business, as it can mean the difference between success and failure. You want your employees to be happy, and to feel fulfilled. A happy employee is typically a productive employee. When an employee is disgruntled or unhappy, productivity typically falls.  
As Jim Bennett said a couple of weeks ago in Partner Power Hour, find a place where you are happy. Find a good manager to work for, or if you are a manager, BE that manager that people WANT to work for.
