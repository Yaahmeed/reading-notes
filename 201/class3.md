# Class 3 Notes

## Foundations

HTML lists, Control Flow with JS and CSS Box Model are important to know to ensure proper layout of our page as well as to ensure our code works how we want it to.

### Learn HTML (Ordered and Unordered lists)

1. An unordered list is used when you have a list with no specific order.
2. You change the bullet style of unordered list items by using the type attribute or by applying CSS style to your <"ul"> and <"li"> tags.
3. An ordered list is used when you have a list that requires a specific order.
4. Two ways to change numbers on list items of an ordered list are: using type:i attribute for roman numerals or start="4" attribute to start the list at the number 4; or you can use CSS.

### Learn CSS (The Box Model)

1. In a story called "The Box Model", the role of margin is to wrap the contents of the box and keep it separate from other boxes and contents; the role of padding is to "cushion" the content that is inside of the box.
2. The 4 parts of an HTML element box are:
    * Content box: area your content is displayed
    * Padding box: area around where your content is displayed
    * Border box: wraps the content and any padding
    * Margin box: outermost layer that *wraps all content, padding, and border between this box and other elements.

### Learn JS (Arrays, Operators, and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops)

1. Arrays can store strings, numbers, objects, and other arrays.
2. It is an array, however, it is a poorly formatted array. When called individually (I used console.log(people[0])), the name with all of the associated information inside of the [ ] will be the information pulled and displayed.
3. 5 shorthand operators in JS are:
    * = Assigns a value
    * += Addition assignment
    * -= Subtraction assignment
    * *= Multiplication assignment
    * /= Division assignment
4. The result is "10dog". 10+false is 10 and 10+dog is 10dog.
5. A real world example of when a conditional should be used in a JS program would be when we are looking for a certain condition to be true or false and have different outcomes. ie: "Are you located within our service area?" if yes "Our trip charge is $x" else if "The trip charge is $x+" else "We will not travel that far."
6. A loop is useful when you want to run the same code but with different variables, such as with math equations.

### Things I want to know more about

* Storing data in arrays and calling the data to be used at a later time.
* Loops - additional uses of for while loops
