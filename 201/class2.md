# Foundations

## Basics of HTML, CSS, and JS

### HTML

1. It is important to use semantic elements to give our content correct meaning, function, or appearance. The browser will give semantic elements certain priorities by default. It can also make debugging easier.

2. There are 6 heading levels in HTML.

3. <"sup"> and <"sub"> elements, "superscript" and "subscript", can/need to be used when marking up items such as dates, chemical formulae, and mathematical equations so that they have the correct meaning.

4. Ad <"abbr"> element should have a "title=" attribute to fully expand the term so that it is more easily accessible with screen readers and such.

### CSS

1. Using CSS, we can make our HTML web pages look good! We can change fonts, colors, backgrounds, locations on our page, and more! This can be accomplished through an external stylesheet, internal stylesheet, inline styling.

2. Inline styling is the least efficient implementation of CSS for maintenance. Inline CSS also makes the HTML more difficult to read and understand.

3. Question 1. The representing selector in the displayed code block is "h2".
Question 2. The CSS declarations in the displayed code block is everything falling between the { } brackets. A declaration is when the property is paired with a value. In this case the declarations are "color: black; padding: 5px;"
Question 3. In the displayed code block, the properties are "color:" and "padding:"

### JS

1. A data type that is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks is called a 'string'

2. 4 types of JS operators are: mathematical (addition +, subtraction -, multiplication *, division /); assignment =; strict equality ===; not, does-not-equal !==

3. A real world problem that you can solve with a function is any mathematical equation.

#### Making Decisions In Your Code - Conditionals

1. An if statement checks a CONDITION and if it evaluates to TRUE, the code block will execute.

2. "else if" is used when we have multiple choices or outcomes. It is a way to chain extra choices/outcomes inside of an "if" "else" statement.

3. 3 different types of comparison operators are: greater or less than < >; greater than or equal to/less than or equal to <= =>; === and !== to test if one value is identical to, or not identical to, another value.

4. logical operators: && vs ||:
&& AND; allows you to chain together 2 or more expressions so that all of them have to individually evaluate to "true" for the whole expression to return "true"
|| OR; allows you to chain together 2 or more expressions so that one or more of them have to individually evaluate to "true" for the whole expression to return "true"
