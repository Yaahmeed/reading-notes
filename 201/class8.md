# Foundations  

## Why these topics matter as it relates to this this module  

- CSS layout is very important to our pages as it will style our pages to be more welcoming and user friendly.  

### Flexbox  

1. One-dimential content means that the flexbox model can take many items of different sizes, and return the best layout for the items. The box dimentions and text will "flex" as needed.  
2. main axis - the main axis is set by your flex-direction property  
  cross axis - the cross axis is the other direction to the main axis  
3. Using certain properties of the flexbox can negatively impact accessibility as they will change the order of appearance on a webpage, but does not change the logical order in the HTML document. This is problematic for a screen reader, as that screen reader will follow the order in the HTML document.  

### Layout - Flexbox  

1. Flexbox is much more "flexible", so to speak, than using float. Float can be frusterating to use and have unintended consequences. Flex will act like a block level element in how it interacts with the rest of the page. Overall, its easier to use, with fewer unintended consequences.  
2. I suspect that using the flexbox will be necessary on our current lab (the table) and it will be useful long term for making a website or app using CSS look how we want to make it look.
