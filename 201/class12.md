# Foundations  

## Why these topics matter as it relates to this this module  

We will need to know how to make a chart that takes data input and displays it on a chart.

### JS Canvas  

1. `<canvas>` allows a developer to draw 2D graphics.  
2. The importance of the closing `</canvas>` tag is to contain any content to fallback upon in case the browser doesn't support the `<canvas>` element.  
3. `getContext()` returns a render context object.  

### Chart.js Documentation  

1. Chart.js is a "prebuilt" chart that will display data and render it on our page. It can be brought into "odd-duck" by displaying on a chart how many times each item was clicked.  
2. 3 different chart types we can create using Chart.js are: bar, line, and radar.  

### Animated Charts  

1. An advantage of displaying data in a chart over a table is that a chart is easier to read and comprehend.  
2. Chart.js could have made the data output/sales data form on "salmon-cookies" much more appealing and easier to read.
