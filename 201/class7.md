# Foundations  

## Why these topics matter as it relates to this this module  

- The reading today is important to the foundations of software development to make web pages and apps look and work the way we have designed them to.  

## Domain Modeling  

1. We need domain modeling in order to effeciently store different properties and attributes in objects and display them on our page as desired/needed.  

## HTML Table basics  

1. Tables should NOT be used for layouts because they are designed to handle tabular data. Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users. Tables produce "tag soup" - too many markup tags making the code harder to write, maintain, and debug. Tables are not automatically responsive - extra measures are needed to get table layout styling to work effectively across different devices.  

2. Three different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML table are:  
    1. `<td>` This is Table Data  
    2. `<tr>` This is a Table Row  
    3. `<th>` This is a Table Header  

## Constructors  

1. A constructor is used to create more than one object from a single object definition. An advntage to using constructors is that we don't have to change our code multiple times in multiple places. We also won't have to repeat our code as frequently.

2. `this.` in an object literal is used to call something in `this` object only  
   `this.` in a constructor is used to call `this` constructor  

## Object Prototypes using a Constructor  

Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

1. A prototype and inheritance in HVAC would be a gas furnace requeres 'x' amount of fuel input to create 'x' amount of heat output. Heat output will change based on outlet gas pressure, CFM air movement, and static pressure.

## Things I want to know more about
