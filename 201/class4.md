# Class 4 Notes

## Foundations

### Why these topics matter as it relates to this this module

HTML Hyperlinks, JS Functions, and CSS Layout are important to know to ensure proper structure and layout of our page. JS functions are important as they are reusable blocks of code. (It's better to write it once and call it later than to have to write the same code block multiple times!)

### HTML Hyperlinks

1. anchor tags with an internal href. ie: <"a href="webpage.com">Webpage</a">
2. The href attribute contains the HypertextRefrence or target that contains the web address.
3. We can ensure the links on our pages are accessible to all readers by including a title attribute to contain additional information about the link.

### CSS Layout

1. Normal flow is the way the webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven't changed their layout.
2. Inline elements sit inline with each other (inside of a block). Block-level elements separate different blocks from eachother.
3. Static
4. An absolute positioned element in not in the normal document flow and is on a separate layer from everything else. This can be useful as we can create isolated UI features on the page that won't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page. ie: information boxes, menus, rollover panels, and other features.
5. Absolute positioning will take the element out of the normal document flow, whereas fixed positioning will fix the element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor. Fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.

### JS Functions

1. A function declaration declares a function for use later. A function invocation calls a function for use.
2. Parameters are sometimes called arguments, properties, or attributes. Parameters are values that need to be included inside of the function parentheses in order to do its job properly.

### Miscellaneous

1. 2 benefits for pair programming are Learning from fellow students and Engaged collaboration. I know that I have a lot to learn. We are all at different skill levels and confidence levels and can learn a lot from each other. Somebody else (paired programming partner) will probably have a different approach to a problem than I do. This is a great learning opportunity to see things from another perspective as well as to learn! There is typically more than one approach to writing code and solving a problem!

### Things I want to know more about

* JavaScript functions - what technically makes a function a function?
Is an alert technically a function? (Just a bit more clarity for how I can think about these and designate them in my mind.)
