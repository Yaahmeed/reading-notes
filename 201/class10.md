# Foundations  

## Why these topics matter as it relates to this this module  

- Debugging is extremely important! We need to know how to find and fix what went wrong in our code!  

### Troubleshooting JS  

1. Syntax error is when there are spelling errors in your code that cause the program to not run at all, or stop working while in use.  
Logic error is when the syntax is correct, but the code is not what you intended it to be. The program runs, but gives incorrect results.  
2. I have encountered both. Usually my syntax isn't too far off but I've had some doozies with logic. I haven't created any infinite loops in this class, but I unintentionally did in 102! Most of my logix errors in the labs of this class have been related to where I am pulling information from. It's been a somewhat difficult slope to learn on, but I am learning what I can/need to put where to make my code do what I intend. ie: trying to use a variable from the wrong function, not creating a new variable in the right place.
3. I will continue to become better at writing my logic and using the correct syntax. The topic of debugging will help me in the future to improve my own code and to be able to look at existing code and figure out what is happening that shouldn't and vice versa.  

### The JS Debugger  

1. The JavaScript debugger tool is a very handy tool to find where your code failed, or what is happening in certain parts of your code, given the correct log commands. It will tell you where the problem is (what line), and what issue it faced.  
2. a breakpoint allows you to set places in your code where you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly. (Ref: mdn docs)  
3. The "call stack" allows you to see what code was executed to get to the current line.  

## Things I want to know more about  

- Using the console log / debugger effeciently. (How to read it.)
