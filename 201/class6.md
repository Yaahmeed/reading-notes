# Foundations  

## Why these topics matter as it relates to this this module  

- JS objects are a great way to organize our data and code in order to make our code more readable, and to reuse pieces of existing code.  The DOM is great for pace manipulation.  

### JS Objects Basics  

1. A JavaScript Object is a collection of related data and/or functionality. ie: A box of Lego's is an object, as it is a collection of related parts (data), and also related functionality (blocks used to build).  
2. Some advantages to creating object literals are: easy to read, easy to work with than identifying individual items by name.  
3. Objects are easier to work with than arrays when you want to identify individual items by name.  It seems simpler to identify individual pieces of data in an object than in an array.  
4. Bracket use to access an object's property would be necessary if the object property is held in a variable.  
5. "this." refers to the current object that the code is being written inside of. In this case, the term "this." refers to "dog". It becomes especially useful when you have several objects within another object.  

### Introduction to the DOM  

1. The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents that represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.  
2. The DOM is what allows JS to interact and affect our HTML.
