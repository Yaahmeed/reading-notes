# Class 5 Notes

## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

* CSS is used to create great looking web pages
* It allows control of exactly how HTML elements look in the browser
* Change colors, sizes, layout
* CSS uses declarations inside of curly braces {} to tell a page how to look.
* This will change all < h1 > tags to be Arial font and color red
* Use CSS to change and adjust placement on the webpage using border, margin, padding

### Add CSS to your page

* In order to add working CSS to your page, you will need a link element inside of the < head> of your page to link your page to your CSS file
ie: < link rel="stylesheet" href="css-doc-name.css">
* Inside of your newly created CSS file is where you will make the CSS changes to style your website
* It is possible to use internal or inline CSS in your HTML document, however this should only be done in special cases, such as if one single HTML page or a single element has a unique style.
* CSS will apply changes to the most specific tag. If you change all < p> tags to be green, but you have one classed differently, you can use the class to change the color and such of that one specific tag.

As stated many times before, USE YOUR RESOURCES!!!
