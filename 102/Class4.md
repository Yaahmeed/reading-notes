# Class 4 Notes

## Wireframing

* Website basic layout
* Decide what should go where and sketch it out
* Add some details

## Steps of design

There are several different processes for going from outline to finished product. What makes the most sense to me, at this point is the following process:

* Sketch
* Wireframe
* Visual
* Code

User flows

* Where are your users coming from, how do they navigate the webpage?

A Good Wireframe

* Clear and concise (Dont get too carried away with the fine detials now) - What is the page for? What goes where? Logo, Pictures, Text, Buttons
* Confidence - Ease of navigation/webpage layout.
* Keep it simple!

## HTML

* Hyper Text Markup Language (most basic building block of a website)
* Defines meaning and applies structure to a web page. (HOW it looks)
* HTML is a series of elements (<>) used to enclose or wrap different parts of a website contents to make it appear a certain way (structure).
* Elements - Opening and Closing tags.
* Elements may contain attributes.
* Attributes can be used to change specific things such as font or color by identifying sections of HTML and using CSS to make these changes.
* Nesting attributes - Using certain attributes inside of tags in order to highlight certain text. ie: adding strong inside of a p tag to make a word bold.

## HTML Document Anatomy

* MUST be the correct !DOCTYPE html
* html language=english-us
* head
* body
* heading
* h1, h2, h3, etc
* Don't forget your closing tags!

## Semantics

* Semantics in programming refers to the meaning of a piece of code. (ie: What does that code DO?)
* Example: h1 (surrounded by <>) is the largest heading, h2 (again, surrounded by <>) is second largest, and so on.
