# Class 6 Notes

## JavaScript

* Used to make a webpage dynamic
* Function, action, activity.
* Can be used for animation/multimedia

### 3 major parts of JavaScript

* The language itself (browser and server sides)
* The DOM API (how the language can interct with various parts of a web page while in the browser)
* The server API (provided by one of the server side systems)

### How/Where to write JS

* You can use a standard text editor to write it, however using a code editor will be easier and better with the added features you gain in the code editor.
* You can either embed JS directly into your HTML file, or you can add a line to your HTML that will link to your JS file. (In most cases, you want to link to your external JS file)
* JS is/can be used for website pop-ups.
* Dynamic components

Based on user input
Use a conditional statement to determine output

* How you name a variable (container for storing data)
* All JS variable identifiers must have unique names. Name your variable based on the data it will be holding.
* Names are case sensitive
* console.log("hello");
* document.write("hello");
* prompt(What is your name?);
* let usersName = prompt("What is your name?");
* console.log("Hello" + usersName + "welcome to my page!");

### Conditional logic

* If/Else - If - true do this. Else - do that.
* if(usersName == "Yaz"){
console.log("Hi Yaz");
} else { console.log("Hello there!")
}

### Data types

* Numbers (integers)
* Strings (text) (data wrapped in quotation marks 'hello')
* Boolean - true/false (on/off)

### Variables

* let - can be changed
* const - can't be changed

### How computers work

* Input
* Storage
* Processing
* Output
